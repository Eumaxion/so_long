## Description

The goal was to create a small 2D game using the MiniLibX graphical library.
The player moves through a map, collects all collectibles, and reaches the exit to win.
It was my first experience combining graphics, events, and logic in a C program.
Throughout the project, I learned how to handle textures, sprites, keyboard inputs, and window rendering.
## Usage

Clone the repository:  

```  
git clone https://github.com/Eumaxion/so_long.git
cd so_long

```
Compile the mandatory part:  

```make```

Run the game with a map file:  
(there are some examples that you can use in maps folder)  

```./so_long ./assets/maps/map.ber```

Compile the bonus part:  

```make bonus```

Run the game with a map file:  
(there are some examples that you can use in maps folder)  

```./so_long_bonus ./assets/maps/bonus_map.ber```

## Skills Developed

Using the MiniLibX graphics library  
Handling keyboard input and window events

Applying clean code structure and memory management in C  
## Status

Project: Complete  
Final Grade: 100/100

Note: I had nice pleasure working on this project, so I decided to increment it, soon I'll update this repository with more features (off from the course subject).
